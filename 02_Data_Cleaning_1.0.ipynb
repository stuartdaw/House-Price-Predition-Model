    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IDEAL\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal scenario is that the regression model I produce will be able to accurately predict the house price of previously unseen houses with only their features provided. This could be used for investors, estate agents and house sellers to allow for better decision making. It will also allow these stakeholders to make understand what drives prices. Different things will be able to be inferred. It could range from advice on home improvements to potential investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. REALITY\n",
    "\n",
    "I have the Ames housing data which has to be cleaned, organised and improved to enable me to tune my model. The data in its current state will not provide a very useful model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CONSEQUENCES\n",
    "\n",
    "Without cleaning the data and tuning the model the users wont be able to predict the house prices very accurately. This means that my stakeholders wont be able to have the information they require to make good decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PROPOSAL\n",
    "\n",
    "My proposal is to start by cleaning the data and discover features that have a good correlation to the sales price. I will start by creating a baseline then start modelling with features and see if the baseline can be improved. As I refine and create features these iterations will continuosly improve the model. Success will be an accurate model and wone I can deduce key features and infer some valuable insights for my stakeholders. I will use Linear regression with ridge, lasso and elasticnet regularisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "N.b. Kaggle Submission and Score will also be a measure of accuracy of the model and project requirement\n"

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some key features in predicting house prices that can give buyers and sellers some important strategies for getting the best house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to know what is important in deciding how much a property is worth and how much investment should be made to increase its current value. If you dont know what these drivers are then expensive mistakes could be made or bargains could be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have developed a model to predict house prices in the Ames area. It can predict the price given the houses attributes. It has also been used to infer some key features which are important. These include living area, overall quality and key locations. Basements are also important in Ames. However the shape of the property and other external features can affect the price in a negative way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was tested on Kaggle and had an RMSE Score of 35,730. Read more to gain further insights into the Ames housing market.\n",
